This pre-built μACM core is a mix between CERN-OHL-P-2.0 and ISC (the
latter being for the included SERV core). It also contains a firmware
licensed under MIT.

 All the details can be found in the Nitro μACM git repository
 ( https://github.com/no2fpga/no2muacm ) but from a practical user stand
 point, the only thing required when using this core is attribution to :

 - Nitro FPGA project ( Sylvain Munaut - https://github.com/no2fpga/ )
 - SERV ( Olof Kindgren - https://github.com/olofk/serv )
